PREAMBLE
This “Big Innovation Research and Development Lab - Artificial Intelligence Research License'' was produced by BirdL, a leader in immersive experiences using artificial intelligence. BirdL is dedicated to enabling an open access Metaverse with a priority on enabling open science and reproducibility. BirdL uses learning based Models which aren’t free of unethical consequences. This license aims to mitigate these concerns. Source Code, Models, and other Artifacts are under specific license terms which will be stated individually throughout this document.


This license strives to enable open access to Immersive Experiences and research Artifacts. When it comes to the open character, we took inspiration from other open source permissive licenses regarding the grant of IP Rights. We have added use-based restrictions to each section regarding an Artifact or type of Artifact to ensure the responsible usage of these tools. The licensor may enforce the license when potential misuse of this technology occurs. 


Even though derivative versions of these Artifacts could be released under different licensing terms, the latter will always have to include at minimum 
* The same use-based restrictions as the ones in the original license for the relevant Artifact type.


We still strive to promote open and responsible research on generative models and will continue to work towards an appropriate balance allowing responsible development of Immersive Experiences while accounting for potential misuse of this technology and other Artifacts that come out of its development.


NOW THEREFORE, You and Licensor agree as follows:


* “License” means the terms and conditions for use, reproduction. And Distribution as defined in this document.
* “Artifact” a production (Source Code, Immersive Experiences, Models, Etc.) made by the Licensor or related entities under this License.
* “Commercial Usage” an application or usage of any Artifact that generates more than 50,000 USD within a year.
* “Immersive Experience” a multimedia application utilizing Artificial Intelligence, VR, AR, or other future BirdL technology.
* “Data” means a collection of information synthesized or collected via internal or external work. “Data” is primarily used for statistics, and teaching Model(s).
* “Asset” a file classified as a multimedia output including: image, video, music, text, etc.
* “Output” means the results of operating a Model as embodied in informational content resulting therefrom.
* “Model” means any accompanying machine-learning based assemblies consisting of learnt weights, parameters, corresponding to the model architecture as embodied in the relevant Complementary Material.
* “Derivatives of an Artifact” means all modifications to an Artifact that are used by You for any purpose.
* “Complementary Material” means the accompanying code source code and scripts used to define, run, load, benchmark or evaluate the model, and used to prepare data for training or evolution.  This also includes accompanying documentation, tutorials, examples, etc.
* “Distribution” means any transmission, reproduction, publication, or other sharing of the Artifact or Derivatives of an Artifact to a Third Party, including hosting services made available by electronic or other remote means - e.g. API-based or web access.
* “Licensor” means the copyright owner or entity authorized by the copyright owner that is granting the License. This also includes other persons or entities that may have rights in the model and or disturbing the model.
* “You” (or “Your”) means an individual or Legal Entity exercising permissions granted by this License and/or making use of the Model including in an end-use application - e.g. chatbot, translate, image generator.
* “User” You or any other person(s) who use any Artifact for any purpose.
* “Third Parties”  means individuals that are not under common control with Licensor or You.
* “Contribution” means any work of authorship regarding the creation of this Model that is intentionally submitted to the Licensor for inclusion in the Model.
* “Contributor” means Licensor and any individual or legal entity on behalf of whom a contribution has been received by the Licensor and included in the Model
        
Section II: INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS 


Both copyright and patent grants apply to the Model, Derivatives of the Model and Complementary Material. The Model and Derivatives of the Model are subject to additional terms as described in Section III. 


1. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable copyright license to reproduce, prepare, publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the Complementary Material and all types of Artifacts given it is not under Commercial Use.


Section III: CONDITIONS OF USAGE, DISTRIBUTION AND REDISTRIBUTION 


2. Distribution and Redistribution. You may host for Third Party remote access purposes (e.g. software-as-a-service), reproduce and distribute copies of the Model or Derivatives of the Model thereof in any medium, with or without modifications, provided that You meet the following conditions. You must categorize the Artifact to the relevant Use-Based Restrictions. You must have the relevant Use-Based Restrictions explicitly stated. You must always explicitly state the general Use-Based Restrictions regardless of if the artifact does not fit into a classification.


Section IV: OTHER PROVISIONS 


3. Nothing in this License permits You to make use of Licensors’ trademarks, trade names, logos or to otherwise suggest endorsement or misrepresent the relationship between the parties; and any rights not expressly granted herein are reserved by the Licensors.
